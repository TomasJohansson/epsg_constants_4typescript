This TypeScript library simply provides one JavaScript class 'EpsgNumber' with lots of EPSG constants.  
Those constants can be used for getting intellisense help, for example when using Visual Studio Code.

When the class was generated, the EPSG dataset version 10.011 was used.  
Those EPSG version numbers (10.11) are also used for the major/minor numbers of this npm package (with version 10.11.1).  
(the last part, the so called patch number i.e. "1" in "10.11.1" is only for this JavaScript/TypeScript library i.e. not related to the EPSG dataset version)


Regarding the data itself: Ownership of the [EPSG](https://epsg.org) Dataset by IOGP is acknowledged as in the
